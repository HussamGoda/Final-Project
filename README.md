**Introduction and Overview:**
-
- The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the case status of visa applications, the aims to to provide valuable insights for both applicants and immigration authorities, contributing to more efficient and informed decision-making.

**Step 1: Data Analysis and Visualization:**
-
This project also involved preforming an exploratory analysis on the dataset in order to gain a better understanding of general themes associated with US visa approvals.

- The total study is an overarching analysis that provides a comprehensive view of the dataset.

- The most Application from Asia
- Among different continents, Europe has the highest work visa certification rate (81%).
- The lowest work visa certification rate belongs to South America (64%).
 

<img src="https://github.com/HussamGoda/Final-Project/blob/main/Images/Education.png" width="400" alt="Education">
- It is clear that the higher the education level of an applicants is, the more their chances of visa certification are.
 

<img src="https://github.com/HussamGoda/Final-Project/blob/main/Images/Region.png" width="400" alt="Region">
- It appears that the visa applications filed by the employers within the Midwest region have the highest probability (77%) of certification. 
- The employers located in the Northeast, West, and Island regions have lower chances (61%) of visa certification.

- The data highlights a predominant salary range of 40k to 80k among visa applicants, and it shows higher incomes don't consistently result in higher approval rates. 
- Intriguingly, the analysis demonstrates a correlation between education levels and income expectations, with more highly educated candidates often seeking higher salaries.
