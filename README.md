**Step 2 - Data Processing**
-
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets


**Step 3 - Model Training and Selection**
-
We set out to predict the outcome of visa certification applications utilizing three different algorithms as below.

- Neural Network
- SVM
- Logistic Regression

**Step 3 - Model Evaluation**
-
We used cross-validation to improve predictive accuracy of the model.


**Step 5 - Model Deployment**
