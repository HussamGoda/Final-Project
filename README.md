**Exploring US Working Visa Applications**
-
**Contributers:**  Hussam Goda, Kashif Bashir, Yoshie Hara


**Overview:** 
-
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the case status of visa applications, the aims to to provide valuable insights for both applicants and immigration authorities, contributing to more efficient and informed decision-making.

**Methodology:**
-
- Exploratory Data Analysis with Tableau
- Data Processing
- Model Training and Selection
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment


**Step 1: ETL and Preprocessing:**
-
This project also involved preforming an exploratory analysis on the dataset in order to gain a better understanding of general themes associated with US visa approvals.

- General Observation as below:
- Asia is the leading source of visa applications.
- Europe boasts the highest certification rate at 81%. Meanwhile, South America has the lowest certification rate at 64%.
- Doctorate holders having an 89% success rate, compared to high school degree holders only records34%. We can tell that Education level strongly influences certification.
- Midwest employers have a high certification rate of 77%.
- Salary expectations show a common range of 40k to 80k, and higher income doesn't guarantee the higher chance of approval.


**Step 2 - Data Processing:**
-
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets


**Step 3 - Model Training and Selection:**
-
We set out to predict the outcome of visa certification applications utilizing three different algorithms as below.

- Neural Network
- Logistic Regression

**Step 4 - Model Evaluation:**
-
We used cross-validation to improve predictive accuracy of the model.


**Step 5 - Model Deployment:**
-


**Findings**
